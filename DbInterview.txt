ACID Property explain

1. A - Atomicity
Definition: Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit. Either the entire transaction succeeds, or none of its parts are applied to the database. If any part of the transaction fails, the database is left unchanged.

Example: Consider transferring money between two bank accounts:

Debit $100 from Account A.
Credit $100 to Account B.
If the debit step succeeds but the credit step fails (e.g., due to a network issue), the database must undo the debit, ensuring the balance remains correct.

2. C - Consistency
Definition: Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. After the transaction, all data must comply with the defined integrity constraints.

Example:

In a banking database, the sum of all account balances must always be equal to the total money in the bank.
Even after a transfer or withdrawal, this rule is preserved.
3. I - Isolation
Definition: Ensures that multiple transactions can occur simultaneously without interfering with each other. The intermediate state of a transaction should not be visible to other concurrent transactions.

Example:

If two transactions are running:
Transaction 1: Transfers $100 from Account A to Account B.
Transaction 2: Transfers $200 from Account B to Account C.
Each transaction should behave as if it’s running alone. The final result should not depend on the order in which they are executed.
4. D - Durability
Definition: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanently recorded in the database, even in the event of a system failure.

Example:

After transferring $100 from Account A to Account B, if the system crashes, the transaction’s result (both debit and credit) must still be present in the database after recovery.
Summary with Example:
Use Case: Bank Account Transaction
A transaction involves:

Debit $100 from Account A.
Credit $100 to Account B.
Atomicity: If the debit fails or the credit fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, ensuring no partial results.
Consistency: The sum of Account A and B’s balances remains unchanged after the transaction.
Isolation: Other transactions querying Account A or B during this process won’t see an inconsistent intermediate state.
Durability: Once completed and committed, the transfer is permanent, even if the system crashes afterward.
Conclusion
ACID properties ensure that database transactions are processed reliably, maintaining data integrity and ensuring the trustworthiness of the database system.



Here are some commonly asked **SQL interview questions** with detailed answers:

---

### **1. What is SQL?**
**Answer:**
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is used for querying, updating, and managing data in a relational database system.

---

### **2. What is the difference between `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`?**
**Answer:**
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN** (or **LEFT OUTER JOIN**): Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. If no match is found, `NULL` is returned for columns from the right table.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT users.name, orders.product
FROM users
INNER JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```
This query only returns users who have orders.

```sql
SELECT users.name, orders.product
FROM users
LEFT JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```
This query returns all users, whether they have placed an order or not.

---

### **3. What is the difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL`?**
**Answer:**
- **`UNION`**: Combines the result of two queries, removing duplicates from the result set.
- **`UNION ALL`**: Combines the result of two queries without removing duplicates, and may include the same row multiple times.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT name FROM users
UNION
SELECT name FROM employees;
```
This query returns unique names from both tables.

```sql
SELECT name FROM users
UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM employees;
```
This query returns all names, including duplicates.

---

### **4. What is normalization and denormalization?**
**Answer:**
- **Normalization**: The process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and dependency by dividing large tables into smaller tables and defining relationships between them. The goal is to reduce data anomalies (update, insert, and delete anomalies). 
  - **Forms**: First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), Third Normal Form (3NF).
  
- **Denormalization**: The process of merging data from multiple tables into one, often for performance reasons. It increases redundancy to improve read performance (reduces the number of joins during queries).

---

### **5. Explain the use of `GROUP BY` in SQL.**
**Answer:**
The `GROUP BY` statement is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, such as finding the number of items per group or the total price per category. It is often used with aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, and `MIN()`.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as number_of_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```
This query groups employees by department and counts the number of employees in each department.

---

### **6. What are indexes in SQL and why are they used?**
**Answer:**
An **index** is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table at the cost of additional space and potential performance hits on insert/update operations. Indexes are used to speed up search queries on large tables.

- **Primary Index**: Automatically created for primary key columns.
- **Unique Index**: Ensures that the values in the indexed column are unique.
- **Composite Index**: An index on multiple columns.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON employees(name);
```
This query creates an index on the `name` column in the `employees` table.

---

### **7. What is a `subquery` in SQL?**
**Answer:**
A **subquery** is a query nested inside another query. It can be used to return a single value or multiple values and is typically used in the `WHERE`, `HAVING`, or `FROM` clause.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT name FROM employees 
WHERE department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name = 'HR');
```
In this query, the subquery retrieves the ID of the 'HR' department, and the main query uses that ID to find employees in that department.

---

### **8. What is a `PRIMARY KEY`?**
**Answer:**
A **PRIMARY KEY** is a field or combination of fields in a database table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. It must contain unique values and cannot contain `NULL`.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);
```
Here, `id` is the **primary key** of the `users` table.

---

### **9. What is the difference between `HAVING` and `WHERE` in SQL?**
**Answer:**
- **`WHERE`**: Used to filter rows before grouping and aggregation.
- **`HAVING`**: Used to filter groups after the `GROUP BY` clause, usually with aggregate functions.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Using WHERE
SELECT department, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000
GROUP BY department;

-- Using HAVING
SELECT department, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```
In the first example, `WHERE` filters employees with a salary greater than 50,000. In the second example, `HAVING` filters departments where there are more than 10 employees.

---

### **10. What is a `transaction` in SQL?**
**Answer:**
A **transaction** is a sequence of one or more SQL operations executed as a single unit. Transactions are used to ensure that a group of statements either all execute or none execute, ensuring the integrity of the database.

- **ACID Properties**:
  - **Atomicity**: The transaction is all or nothing.
  - **Consistency**: The database remains consistent after the transaction.
  - **Isolation**: Transactions are isolated from each other.
  - **Durability**: Changes made by a transaction are permanent.

**Commands**:
- `START TRANSACTION`
- `COMMIT` (to save changes)
- `ROLLBACK` (to undo changes)

**Example:**
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO accounts (balance) VALUES (1000);
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE id = 1;
COMMIT;
```
This ensures that both the `INSERT` and `UPDATE` occur together.

---

### **11. What is the `AUTO_INCREMENT` keyword in MySQL?**
**Answer:**
The `AUTO_INCREMENT` keyword in MySQL is used to automatically increment the value of a column (typically the primary key) with each new row inserted. It ensures that each row has a unique value for that column.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

---

### **12. What is the difference between `TRUNCATE` and `DELETE`?**
**Answer:**
- **`DELETE`**: Removes rows from a table based on a condition (can be rolled back in transactions). It can be slow for large datasets and doesn't free up the storage space.
- **`TRUNCATE`**: Removes all rows from a table without a condition and cannot be rolled back. It is faster and frees up storage space.

**Example:**
```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE age < 30;
TRUNCATE TABLE users;
```

---

### **13. What is `LIKE` in SQL?**
**Answer:**
The `LIKE` operator in SQL is used to search for a specified pattern in a column. The wildcard characters used are:
- `%` (represents zero or more characters)
- `_` (represents a single character)

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'John%';
```
This query finds all users whose name starts with "John."
