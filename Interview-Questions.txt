Q15. shallow comparison and deep comparison?? example 
let a = {a: 3}
let b = {a: 3}
let c = b;  
 
console.log(a==b) //false
console.log(a===b) 	//false
console.log(c==b)   //true	
console.log(c===b)  // true
Objects are compared by reference, not by value.
Even if two objects have the same structure and values, they are considered unequal unless they reference the same memory location.
c is assigned to b, so both variables share the same reference.
This is why c == b and c === b both evaluate to true.
